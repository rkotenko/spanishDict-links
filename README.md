# spanishDict-links
This little javascript snippet is use to add links to other spanish words on a SpanishDict.com definition page.

I use SpanishDict.com a lot for my language studies.  One thing that I notice is missing is clickable links to other spanish words that appear when you search for a definition.  Often times, the words is related to, but not quite the same as the one I am looking up. I think it would be nice to be able to click through to those words. It is relatively to find some of the words using the class names, but others might be challenging due to more generic classes.  This will be a continual work in progress, I think.

The code snippet is meant to be used within something like GreaseMonkey or Custom Javascript (for Chrome) so that it runs on the domain I want and no others.
